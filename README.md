# XRCraft's Website
Because I was too lazy and felt like seeing what AI could do, I made this website along with Copilot agent mode.

This codebase is ass. AI is ass. This is just ass. PR if you want to make it better or some shit like that.

This is complete shit. This was coded using a combo of Gemini 2.5 Pro (for first part before it started to imagine that it wasn't in agent mode) then GPT-4.1. More recent commits are done with Claude 4.
